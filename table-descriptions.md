**The Tracks of Yu: Spatial Data for Yellow River History** is a data publication hub that accompanies Ruth Mostern’s book [*The Yellow River: A Natural and Unnatural History*](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300238334/the-yellow-river/) (Yale University Press, 2021), a three-thousand-year history of China’s Yellow River and the legacy of interactions between humans and the natural landscape. It is a lightly revised version of the data upon which the book was based.

*The Yellow River: A Natural and Unnatural History* demonstrates that from Neolithic times to the present day, the Yellow River and its watershed have both shaped and been shaped by human society. The data presented here is that which allowed Ruth Mostern, for that book to unravel the three millennium history of the human relationship with water and soil and the consequences, at times disastrous, of ecological transformations that resulted from human decisions. It demonstrates how governments consistently ignored the dynamic interrelationships of the river’s varied ecosystems—grasslands, riparian forests, wetlands, and deserts—and the ecological and cultural impacts of their policies. 

[The appendix to *The Yellow River*](https://github.com/YellowRiverDatabase/Documentation/blob/main/The_Yellow_River_A_Natural_and_Unnatural_History_----_\(Appendix_Tracking_Yu_Developing_a_Data_System_for_Yellow_River_History\).pdf) describes the sources that comprise this data collection and the process of database authorship. While we have made changes to the data structure and have made updates based on additional cleaning and accuracy checking, we have not completed new research since 2021 and we have not added new content.

The most substantial changes we have made since the publication of *The Yellow River* relate to the presentation of location information, which was embedded in the data and not disambiguated in the book as published. This has now been made explicit. This permits people to query by place and discover all of the events associated with each place.   
   
The database system as described in the appendix to *The Yellow River* worked as intended for the specific queries and functionality needed for the publication of the text, but since the focus of *The Yellow River* was on events rather than places, constructing a comprehensive and disambiguated gazetteer of locations was not necessary beyond ensuring that places were not duplicated in a specific event. Moreover, the query system was built within a Jupyter Notebook environment that greatly facilitated the work of the *Yellow River* team, but was also largely built around the specific research objectives, idiosyncratic interests, and working preferences of the team.

In order to make the data more accessible and compatible with other research projects and Linked Open Data systems, we have now reorganized the data according to a place-based perspective. Individual places impacted by river events now each have their own entry, and entries are cross-referenced with one other to create a single entry for each place. In addition, each place has its position within the administrative hierarchy defined for each time period. Creating the place name gazetteer involved a comprehensive multi-step process to clean, disambiguate, and enrich historical geographic data. The current version contains 4,225 core entities, each assigned a standardized “yrdb” ID, following the automated merging of exact text matches from a preliminary data dictionary of 6,731 entries. To address the limitations of automated matching, we conducted manual disambiguation using geographic coordinates and source validation to resolve entries with Unicode inconsistencies, formatting anomalies, or ambiguous references. The dataset was further enriched by classifying place names according to feature type, identified through frequency patterns in final characters. We produced a refined typology across administrative, settlement, natural, and water-related categories. To support broader accessibility and machine readability, we added Pinyin transliterations with careful adjustment for polyphonic characters and misclassifications. Supporting documentation tracked original forms and naming conflicts to maintain data transparency. Together, these processes produced a clean, disambiguated, and multilingual gazetteer available on our GitHub site, which supports both academic research and digital mapping applications.  
   
Anchored by a gazetteer of places, this database also offers tables that link places to events, events to event types, places to place types, places to geographic locations, events to sources, names to places, and geographic information including the changing courses of the Yellow River, geographic regions, and political / administrative regions. These are linked by disambiguated common identifiers, such as yrdb\_id being the unique ID for every place and event\_id as the unique ID for events.      

Data publication permits other projects and queries on related topics and allows anybody to explore details about specific places, eras, types of river events, or excerpts from primary sources that the book was not able to address. The data is freely available for download as well as online browsing through a simple online interactive map for exploratory inquiry.

In addition to the database, we have published a web atlas. The atlas is built as a [React](https://react.dev/) web application, using [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/) to render that map, and [Deck.gl](http://Deck.gl) to visualize the data. The React library allows for reactive interaction in modern web applications to update the current state of the site without re-rendering the entire html page. Since its introduction in 2013, React has transformed the way the web works through its reactive architecture that has been adopted across numerous JavaScript frameworks. For our purposes, React allows us to update the data available on the map without reloading the page. It and the DeckGL library are essential to render and update the page. DeckGL helps solve a structural problem in the world of data visualization, which is the need to visualize and explore large quantities of data without over summarizing it. Typical mapping software uses SVG technology to render nodes (data points) as standard HTML DOM (document-object-model, or the architecture of the browser user interface) elements over the top of raster tiles (pre-rendered images of the map). This model is CPU-centeric, limiting its ability to process large, complex datasets such as ours. Mapping libraries built on this architecture tend to slow as the number of features rendered grows closer to 1,000. DeckGL and Mapbox are built on vectorized tiles of the base maps (data representations of geographic features). Mapbox receives raw vector data of the map to render it dynamically, and it uses modern browser APIs (such as WebGL and WebGPU) to gain access to the computer’s Graphical Processing Units to render the map. When mixed with the DeckGL visualization library that similarly uses WebGL2 to accelerate graphics rendering for large quantities of data, we are able to render three-dimensional representations of data that would otherwise take too long to load through non-GPU-accelerated processes.
